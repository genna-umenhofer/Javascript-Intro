// Exercise 1-4

console.log("This is file one");

let foo = "bar";
console.log(foo);
foo;
      /*
        1. This code outputs the string "bar"
        2.
        3. The Chrome REPL shows a SyntaxError that 'foo' has already been identified. This is
        because the code above is running first and then the code I copied is running. If I comment
        out the code above, then it shows 'bar'.
